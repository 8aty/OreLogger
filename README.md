[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%203-pink.svg)](LICENSE)

OreLogger is a lightweight Minecraft plugin designed to track ore mining activity on your server. It logs ores mined by players and sends real-time alerts to Discord and in-game chat (for admins). With customizable settings and cross-world teleportation support, OreLogger is perfect for monitoring resource gathering and preventing griefing or cheating.

## Features

- **Discord Integration**: Sends detailed embeds to a Discord webhook when ores are mined.
- **Admin Alerts**: Sends clickable teleport messages to admins in-game for quick investigation.
- **Configurable Ores**: Customize which ores are tracked via the `config.yml` file.
- **Session Delay**: Group ore mining events into sessions with a configurable delay (default: 15 seconds).
- **Cross-World Teleportation**: Admins can teleport directly to the world and coordinates where ores were mined.
- **Alert Toggle**: Admins can enable/disable alerts using `/orelogger togglealerts`.
- **Reload Command**: Reload the configuration dynamically with `/orelogger reload`.
